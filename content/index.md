        <td style="width: 50%;">I am a researcher currently pursuing my PhD in the fields of Bayesian Learning and Quantum Circuits. 
                                My academic journey has been driven by a fascination with the intersection of machine learning** and quantum computing. 
                                With a strong foundation in statistical methods and computational techniques, I am dedicated to exploring innovative 
                                approaches that leverage quantum technologies for solving complex problems in machine learning.
