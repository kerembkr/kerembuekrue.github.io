### Quantum Kernels
  
Quantum kernels leverage the principles of quantum computing to enhance machine learning algorithms, particularly in the context of kernel methods. The primary objective of this research project is to analyze data more efficiently using quantum algorithms compared to classical approaches.
 
#### Key Concepts
- **Quantum Kernel Function**: The quantum kernel can be expressed as:

  $$ 
  K(x, y) = \langle \psi(x) | \psi(y) \rangle 
  $$

  where \(|\psi(x)\rangle\) and \(|\psi(y)\rangle\) are quantum states corresponding to the classical data points \(x\) and \(y\).

- **Performance Enhancement**: Quantum kernels can potentially provide exponential speedups in certain problems, allowing for the analysis of high-dimensional data that is intractable for classical methods.

- **Technologies**: This project utilizes **Python** and **Qiskit** for implementing quantum algorithms and experimenting with quantum kernel methods.

### Deep Gaussian Processes

Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) extend the standard Gaussian Process (GP) framework by allowing multiple layers of GPs to model complex functions. This approach is particularly effective in capturing intricate relationships within data, making it suitable for various machine learning tasks.

#### Key Concepts
- **Gaussian Process Prior**: A GP is defined by a mean function and a covariance function, typically expressed as:

  $$
  f(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x'))
  $$

  where \(m(x)\) is the mean function and \(k(x, x')\) is the covariance function.

- **Deep Architecture**: In a DGP, multiple GPs are stacked to form a hierarchical model, allowing for more expressive representations of the data:

  $$
  f^{(l)}(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m^{(l)}(x), k^{(l)}(x, x'))
  $$

  for each layer \(l\), where the output of one layer serves as the input to the next.

- **Applications**: DGPs can be applied in regression, classification, and other tasks where capturing uncertainty and complex patterns in data is crucial.

- **Technologies**: This project also employs **Python** and **Qiskit** to implement and analyze DGPs in the context of quantum computing.
